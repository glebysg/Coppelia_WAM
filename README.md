# Coppelia WAM
Barrett WAM robot model for coppeliasim

This repository contains two models:
* wam_force.ttt: developed for force/torque control, velocity control or joint position control.
* wam_ik.ttt: developed to move the end effector through inverse kinematics. 

### Coming soon:
Test the models with the coppeliasim Barrett Hand

These were developed using the CAD files and specs provided by Barrett<sup>TM</sup>: https://advanced.barrett.com/cad-models
